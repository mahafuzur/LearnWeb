```css
p:last-child:after {
   content: "\2766"; /* Here comes the ivy leaf */
   font-size: 150%; /* Makes the leaf larger than the normal text */
   padding-left: 10px; /* Leaf won't clash with the last letter of the text */
   float: right; /* Horizontal position is set to the right edge of the column */
   position: relative; /* This is just an homage to Albert Einstein */
   top: 15px /*Vertical distance from the last line of text */
}

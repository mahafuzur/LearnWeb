title: Give Clickable Elements a Pointer Cursor
---

> Some elements that are clickable mysteriously don't trigger a pointer cursor in browsers. This fixes that, and provides a default class "pointer" for applying it to other clickable things as needed.

```css
a[href], input[type='submit'], input[type='image'], label[for], select, button, .pointer {
       cursor: pointer;
}
```

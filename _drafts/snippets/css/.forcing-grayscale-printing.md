title: Forcing Grayscale Printing
---

 > At the time of this writing, this will only work in Chrome 18+, but it's standardized so support will eventually come to everywhere.

```css
@media print {
  body {
    /* IE4-8 and 9 (deprecated). */
    filter: Gray();
    /* SVG version for IE10, Chrome 17, FF3.5, 
       Safari 5.2 and Opera 11.6 */
    filter: url('#grayscale'); 
    /* CSS3 filter, at the moment Webkit only. Prefix it for
       future implementations */
    -webkit-filter: grayscale(100%); 
    filter: grayscale(100%); /* future-proof */
  }
}
```
